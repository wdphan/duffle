> NFT Community Governance

Quickly create groups or communities with Alchemy's NFT API. After grouping these addresses, individuals have the ability to come up with important questions. People can create proposals or solutions to these questions. Others can vote on the best proposal or solution. 

The owner of the question can delegate funds to the votes, proposal creators, or let the protocol keep the donated funds. Anyone can send funds to the individual questions anytime to incentivize participation within a topic. This was an experiment to improve governance.
